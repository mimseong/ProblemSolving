# ProblemSolving

## About

- A collection of algorithm problem solutions I solved between 2019 and now.
- I have been participating in an algorithm study session every Saturday, and each solution in this repo is a problem solved that week.  
- Mainly solved in C++, with some problems solved in Python.
- Problem solving site: https://www.acmicpc.net/
- and my profile: https://www.acmicpc.net/user/mimseong

## Languages / Tech

- **C++**: primary language  
- **Python**: used for some problems  

## Structure

Each file is named after the problem number (e.g., `1000.cpp`, `10757.py`) corresponding to the problem site ID.  
The repository contains only solution source codes.

## Motivation & Purpose

This repository serves as:  
- a personal archive of problems I’ve solved over time,
- a way to track my progress and improvement in algorithmic problem-solving, and
- a resource to revisit or review past solutions
